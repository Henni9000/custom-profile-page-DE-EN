## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Local Execution

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Henni9000/henni-profile.git
    cd henni-profile
    ```
    *(Make sure the repository name `henni-profile` is correct)*
2.  **Add Music File:** Place your desired music file as `song.mp3` in the project's root directory. *(See license note below)*
3.  **Add Background Image (Optional):** Place your desired background image as `background.jpg` in the root directory. If no image is found, the animated gradient will be used.
4.  **Start a Local Web Server:** Since the page makes API requests (Lanyard) and loads local audio files, it works best when served via a local web server.
    *   **Option 1 (VS Code):** Install the "Live Server" extension and start it.
    *   **Option 2 (Python 3):** `python -m http.server`
    *   **Option 3 (Node.js):** `npm install -g http-server && http-server .`
5.  **Open:** Access the page via the URL provided by the local server (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).

## üîß Customization

*   **Discord User ID:** Change the ID in the `apiUrl` variable in `script.js` to display the status of a different user.
*   **Social Links:** Edit the `<a>` tags within the `<div class="social-links">` section in `index.html`.
*   **Song Title:** Change the text within the `<span class="song-title">` element in `index.html` to match your `song.mp3`.
*   **Translations:** Add new languages or modify existing texts in the `translations` object in `script.js`. Also, update the language buttons and the `setLanguage` logic accordingly.
